'Let Obamacare fail,' Trump declares as GOP plan collapses
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump declared Tuesday it's time to "let Obamacare fail" after the latest GOP health care plan crashed and burned in the Senate, a stunning failure for the president, Republican leader Mitch McConnell and a party that has vowed for years to abolish the law. In a head-spinning series of developments, rank-and-file Republican senators turned on McConnell and Trump for the third time in a row, denying the votes to move forward with a plan for a straight-up repeal of "Obamacare." This time, it was three GOP women — Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia — who delivered the death blow.

Analysis: Trump unlikely to avoid blame for health care loss
NEW YORK (AP) — It was a far cry from "The buck stops here." President Donald Trump, dealt a stinging defeat with the failure of the Republican health care bill in the Senate, flipped the script from Harry Truman's famous declaration of presidential responsibility and declared Tuesday, "I am not going to own it." He had tweeted earlier, "We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans." This is the same president who thundered night after night on the campaign trail that it would be "so easy" to repeal and replace the Obama health care law on Day One of his administration.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer and National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton confirmed that Trump and Putin spoke at a dinner for world leaders and their spouses at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. The conversation came hours after Trump and Putin's first official face-to-face meeting on July 7, which was originally scheduled to last just half an hour but stretched on for more than two. The two world leaders were also captured on video shaking hands and exchanging a few words after they arrived at the G-20 summit of industrialized and developing nations earlier that day.

Iraqi officer seeks vengeance in Mosul, where killings mount
MOSUL, Iraq (AP) — For one Iraqi lieutenant, the fight against the Islamic State group in Mosul has been a slow, methodical quest for revenge. For three years, he has hunted for two IS militants from his village who he believes killed his father. Along the way, he has shot to death detained militants after interrogating them, he acknowledges unapologetically. And if he catches either of the men he is searching for, the lieutenant vows he will inflict on him "a slow death" and hang his body from a post in the village after forcing him to reveal where his father's body is buried.

Officer: Partner fired fatal shot moments after loud sound
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The partner of a Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed an Australian woman who had called 911 told investigators he was startled by a loud sound near their squad car seconds before his partner fired his weapon. Officer Matthew Harrity's account, as given by state investigators, is the first to emerge of the moments leading up to the death of Justine Damond, a 40-year-old meditation teacher and life coach who was due to be married in August. It's also the only one, since Officer Mohamed Noor — who fired the shot that killed Damond — has so far refused to be interviewed.

NEW YORK (AP) — An impending auction of pop star Madonna's personal items, including a love letter from her ex-boyfriend the late rapper Tupac Shakur, a pair of previously worn panties and a hairbrush containing her hair, was halted by a judge on Tuesday. Manhattan state Supreme Court Judge Gerald Leibovitz ordered Gotta Have It! Collectibles to pull 22 items from its rock-and-roll-themed auction scheduled for Wednesday. The Material Girl had earlier sought an emergency court order saying she was "shocked to learn" of the planned online auction of the Tupac letter and had no idea it was no longer in her possession.

Meet Gov. Phil Scott, stock car racer (a pretty good one)
BARRE, Vt. (AP) — Gov. Phil Scott ducks into a trailer, trades his business suit for a racing jumpsuit, climbs into his modified Chevrolet and heads for Thunder Road. When his security detail drives him into the pits at the banked, quarter-mile track, he is no longer Phil Scott, the chief executive of Vermont. He is Phil Scott, long one of the state's most popular stock car racers. "It's something that's in my blood, something I've done for three or four decades," Scott said one recent Thursday before the regular summertime races at Thunder Road.
